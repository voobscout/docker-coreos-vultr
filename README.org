*** Originally submitted as Docker issue [[https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/31995][#31995]]


After booting this config on my local KVM and seeing it work perfectly, it was obvious that

Docker issue #31995
  https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/31995

  The simplest way to reproduce the issue is to clone this repo, change ssh keys and boot 2 kvm instances from provided ipxe files.
  I use vultr.com to accomplish this.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :results drawer :noweb yes
    ssh core@host0.njk.li docker exec macvlan-test ping -c 3 10.99.0.220
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :results drawer
    ssh core@host1.njk.li docker logs tshark
  #+END_SRC
